    <h3>About This Site</h3>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col s12">
            <p>My name is <a class="pink-text" href="http://mlavin.org">Mark Lavin</a> and I created this
            site because I wanted to find some sort of use for my Keybase account. I am not affillidated
            with Keybase in any way. I just have a general interest in making
            public key crypto more publicly accessible. A silly site like this
            one seemed like a good way to do that.</p>
            <p>The messages stored for this site are encrypted on the client and can't be read
            by the server. We only store the message and the selected image. No additional information
            about the person sending or receiving the message is stored beyond the metadata
            which is generated in the GPG message. This site does not include any third-party
            scripts or tracking/analytics tools.</p>
            <p>If you find this site useful or entertaining in any way, I wouldn't
            mind a <a class="pink-text" href="">small donation</a> just to help
            keep the servers running.</p>
